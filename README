=head1 HISTORY

What changed over the last 3 revisions

=over

=item 0.11 Sunday 9th July, 2006

	Fudge around the segfaults in 5.8.x ithreaded builds by
	not looking up what the package variable is.


=item 0.10 Wednesday 5th July, 2006

	Use strlen rather than playing with SvLEN/SvCUR to determine
	the length of identifiers in the pad.  It's a theoretical
	segfault waiting to happen, but one that isn't tickled by the
	current test suite.  Fixes failures under perl 5.8.8 as
	reported by clkao.


=item 0.09 Sunday 5th October, 2003

	Split Changes out from HISTORY pod section.
	Port to Module::Build
	We can now determine constant values in called_with.
	Partial fixes for http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=2878
